# TestApp

**TestApp** is a lightweight iOS application designed to demonstrate the features of frameworks deployed using **XCUIBuilder**. It provides a simple UI for testing and experimenting with various automation patterns, including **Screen Transition Chaining** and **Self Chaining**.

While the app does not include a backend, it offers a clear picture of how the deployed framework handles navigation, assertions, and logging. Simply create new screens with real UI element locators and extend the provided test examples to suit your needs.

This app serves as a starting point for users to explore the capabilities of the frameworks and decide which patterns best suit their projects.
